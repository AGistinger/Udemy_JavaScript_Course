How to Fail....
- Don't have a clear goal
- Started courses and tutorials and would copy code without caring how it works
- Didn't reinforce what was learned in the course by doing small challenges or taking notes
- Dont' come up with his own project ideas

How to Succeed....
- Set a goal for yourself
- Understand the code that you are typing
- Take notes, try to challenge yourself
- Practice on your own
- Come up with your own project ideas
- Don't get stuck of tutorial hell

Think like a Developer: Become a Problem Solver
- Stay calm and slow down
- Take a logical and rational approach
- Use 4-Step framework
  * Make sure you 100% understand the problem
  * Divide and conquer: break a big problem into smaller pieces
  * Don't be afraid to do research
  * Write psuedo-code before writing the actual code

/*
Given an array of forecasted maximum temperatures, the termometer displays a string
with these temperatures.

Example: [17, 21, 23] will print "... 17C in 1 days... 21C in 2 days ... 23C in 3 days..."

Create a function 'print_forecast' which takes in an array 'arr' and logs a string like above to the console.

Use the problem-solving framework: Understand the problem and break it up into sub-problems.
