How to Fail....
- Don't have a clear goal
- Started courses and tutorials and would copy code without caring how it works
- Didn't reinforce what was learned in the course by doing small challenges or taking notes
- Dont' come up with his own project ideas

How to Succeed....
- Set a goal for yourself
- Understand the code that you are typing
- Take notes, try to challenge yourself
- Practice on your own
- Come up with your own project ideas
- Don't get stuck of tutorial hell
